Welcome! This is my GitHub-Website "Mathematics Into Code", where I delve into the algorithmic and computational side of mathematics. Youâ€™ll find a variety of interesting posts that combine mathematical concepts with computational problem-solving.

As the name of my other website <a href="https://www.piecesofmathematics.com" target="_blank">Pieces of Mathematics</a> suggests, you will find there presentations of fascinating pieces of mathematics.
