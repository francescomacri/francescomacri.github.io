Welcome! This is my GitHub-Website _Mathematics Into Code_, where I delve into the algorithmic and computational side of mathematics. Youâ€™ll find a variety of posts that combine mathematical concepts with computational problem-solving. 
The sample implementation within the posts shows usually only the relevant code snippet. The posts usually contain the link to the slightly more complete implementation of the respective algorithm. I say slightly, because it is by no means complete. In fact, I often will omit for example exception handling to keep the code more readable and focused on the mathematics. The code within the repository is intended to be a starting point for further explorations and experimentations.

On my other website <a href="https://www.piecesofmathematics.com" target="_blank">Pieces of Mathematics</a> you will find  presentations of fascinating pieces of mathematics. However, the two websites are not necessarily congruent with respect to the concepts treated.
