Welcome! This is my GitHub-website Mathematics Into Code, where I delve into the algorithmic and computational side of mathematics. Youâ€™ll find a variety of interesting posts that combine mathematical concepts with computational problem-solving.

As the name of my other website [Pieces of Mathematics](https://www.piecesofmathematics.com) suggests, you will find there presentations of fascinating pieces of mathematics.
